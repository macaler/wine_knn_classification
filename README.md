# wine_knn_classification

This is a little project that I did to practice building a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) model. The goal was to use the scikit-learn wine recognition data set to build a KNN model that would classify a wine sample based on various chemical analysis measurements. I was able to build a KNN model which had an accuracy of 96.3% and which only misclassified 1 out of 27 wine samples in my test/validation set.

This project was done with Python 3.0 and Jupyter Notebook. I used the scikit-learn wine recognition data set, and utilized Pandas, Matplotlib, and the scikit-learn packages model_selection and neighbors in my analysis. So long as you have Jupyter Notebook and the named packages installed, the project should run on your machine. The project itself has been included as MAC_wine_knn_classification.ipynb.
